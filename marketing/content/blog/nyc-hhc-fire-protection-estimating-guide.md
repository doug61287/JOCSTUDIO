# NYC HHC Fire Protection Estimating: The Complete Guide

New York City Health + Hospitals (NYC HHC) is the largest public health system in the United States—11 acute care hospitals, 5 post-acute care facilities, and dozens of community health centers across all five boroughs. And they need fire protection work. A lot of it.

**NYC HHC awards over $100 million annually in fire protection contracts**, from sprinkler system upgrades to standpipe replacements to complete suppression overhauls. For fire protection contractors who know how to navigate the HHC JOC system, it's a massive, reliable pipeline of work.

This guide breaks down everything you need to know about NYC HHC fire protection estimating: the JOC structure, Division 21 line items, borough coefficients, and a step-by-step process to price proposals accurately and win work.

## Understanding the NYC HHC JOC Structure

NYC HHC uses Job Order Contracting (JOC) for the majority of its construction, renovation, and repair work. Unlike traditional design-bid-build procurement, JOC allows pre-qualified contractors to bid on task orders using standardized unit prices.

### How HHC JOC Works

1. **Master Contract**: Contractors compete for multi-year JOC contracts by submitting qualifications and a coefficient (markup percentage)
2. **Task Orders**: When HHC has fire protection work, they issue task order requests to their JOC contractors
3. **Standardized Pricing**: Proposals are built using HHC's Unit Price Book (UPB), which establishes costs for every conceivable line item
4. **Coefficient Application**: Your contract coefficient and borough-specific adjustments are applied to the base prices
5. **Quick Turnaround**: Task orders can be approved and work authorized in days, not months

For fire protection contractors, this means predictable, ongoing work—if you know how to estimate within the system.

### The HHC Unit Price Book (UPB)

The UPB is the bible of HHC JOC estimating. It's organized by CSI MasterFormat divisions:

- **Division 21**: Fire Suppression
- **Division 22**: Plumbing (some overlap with fire protection)
- **Division 23**: HVAC (some overlap for fire dampers, etc.)
- **Division 26**: Electrical (fire alarm connections)
- **Division 28**: Electronic Safety and Security (fire alarm systems)

For fire protection contractors, **Division 21** is your home base, but you'll frequently pull line items from adjacent divisions.

## Division 21: Fire Protection Breakdown

Division 21 covers all fire suppression work. Here's how it's organized:

### 21 05 00 — Common Work Results for Fire Suppression

This section includes items that apply to any fire protection project:

| Line Item | Description | Unit | Sample Price |
|-----------|-------------|------|--------------|
| 21 05 00.10 | Mobilization & Demobilization | LS | $1,850.00 |
| 21 05 00.20 | Fire Protection System Drain Down | EA | $425.00 |

| 21 20 20.20 | Fire Extinguisher, ABC Dry Chemical, 10 lb | EA | $125.00 |

## Reading the UPB Schedule

The HHC UPB is a dense document—often hundreds of pages. Here's how to navigate it effectively:

### Structure of a Line Item

Each UPB entry includes:

```
21 10 10.10 | Sprinkler Head, Pendant, Standard Response, 1/2" NPT, 
             155°F Fusible Element, Including Escutcheon
             
             Unit: EA | Base Price: $85.00
             
             Includes: Labor for installation, head, escutcheon, 
             branch line drop (up to 12"), testing
             
             Excludes: Main piping, support, firestop if through 
             rated assembly
```

Understanding what's **included** and **excluded** is critical. The sample above includes the branch line drop—many estimators accidentally double-count this.

### Finding the Right Line Item

The UPB has multiple entries that seem similar. For sprinkler heads alone, you might see:

- Pendant vs. Sidewall vs. Upright
- Standard Response vs. Quick Response
- 1/2" vs. 3/4" NPT
- 155°F vs. 200°F vs. 286°F
- Chrome vs. White vs. Brass finish

**Match the specifications exactly.** Using the wrong line item creates audit findings and potential task order rejection.

### Using Search Effectively

The UPB PDF is searchable. Use specific terms:

- ✅ "pendant 1/2 quick response"
- ✅ "21 10 10" (to browse all sprinkler heads)
- ❌ "sprinkler" (too broad, hundreds of results)

## Coefficients Explained

NYC HHC uses two types of coefficients that affect your final pricing:

### Borough Coefficients

Location matters. Work in Manhattan costs more than work in Staten Island due to labor rates, logistics, and access challenges:

| Borough | Major HHC Facilities | Coefficient |
|---------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Manhattan** | Bellevue, Harlem, Metropolitan, Coler | **1.25** |
| **Bronx** | Jacobi, North Central Bronx, Lincoln | **1.15** |
| **Brooklyn** | Kings County, Woodhull, Coney Island | **1.10** |
| **Queens** | Elmhurst, Queens Hospital Center | **1.10** |
| **Staten Island** | Sea View Hospital | **1.05** |

### Contract Coefficients

Your contract coefficient is what you bid when winning the master JOC contract. It's your markup on the UPB prices and typically ranges from 0.95 to 1.10.

### The Complete Formula

```
Final Price = Base UPB Price × Quantity × Borough Coefficient × Contract Coefficient
```

**Example:**

Installing 50 pendant sprinkler heads at Jacobi Medical Center (Bronx), with a contract coefficient of 1.02:

- Base Price: $85.00 × 50 = $4,250.00
- Borough Coefficient: $4,250.00 × 1.15 = $4,887.50
- Contract Coefficient: $4,887.50 × 1.02 = **$4,985.25**

## Step-by-Step NYC HHC Fire Protection Estimating Process

Here's the workflow for pricing an HHC fire protection task order:

### Step 1: Receive and Review Documents

HHC issues task order requests with:

- Scope of work narrative
- Drawings (PDF, usually)
- Specifications (if applicable)
- Site access information
- Schedule requirements

**First pass**: Read the scope completely. Identify the systems affected (sprinklers, standpipes, fire alarm, etc.) and the nature of work (new installation, modification, repair).

### Step 2: Perform Takeoff

For fire protection, your takeoff typically includes:

**Sprinkler Systems:**
- Count of heads by type (pendant, sidewall, concealed)
- Pipe linear footage by diameter
- Valve quantities
- Support/hanger counts
- Fire department connections

**Standpipes:**
- Riser footage
- Hose valve counts
- Cabinet and extinguisher counts

**General:**
- Firestop penetrations
- Drain/fill points
- Testing and inspection requirements

[DESCRIBE: Screenshot showing takeoff markups on fire protection drawings with color-coded pipe runs and head counts]

### Step 3: Map to UPB Line Items

This is where experience matters. Each takeoff item must match to a specific UPB line item:

| Takeoff Item | UPB Line Item |
|--------------|---------------|
| 25 pendant heads | 21 10 10.10 |
| 150 LF of 2" pipe | 21 10 20.30 |
| 3 firestops (4" penetrations) | 21 05 00.40 |
| 1 alarm check valve | 21 10 30.10 |
| System drain down | 21 05 00.20 |
| System recharge | 21 05 00.30 |
| Mob/demob | 21 05 00.10 |

**Don't forget the supporting items.** Sprinkler heads require branch lines, pipe requires hangers, penetrations require firestops. Map everything.

### Step 4: Apply Coefficients

Extend your quantities by base prices, then apply coefficients in order:

1. Base extended price
2. × Borough coefficient
3. × Contract coefficient
4. = Final proposal price

**Do not round until the final total.** Premature rounding accumulates error.

### Step 5: Build Your Proposal Package

HHC expects:

- Line-item breakdown (UPB format)
- Quantity backup (annotated drawings, calculations)
- Schedule (duration and milestones)
- Any clarifications or qualifications

Keep it clean and auditable. Every number needs backup.

### Step 6: Submit and Respond to Questions

Submit through HHC's designated system. Be prepared for:

- Quantity verification questions
- Line item selection challenges
- Scope clarification requests

Fast, professional responses accelerate approval.

## Common NYC HHC Fire Protection Estimating Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Wrong Line Item Selection

Using "pipe replacement" when you should use "new installation" or vice versa. HHC audits proposals—wrong line items get flagged.

**Solution:** Read the full line item description, including inclusions and exclusions.

### Mistake #2: Missing Borough Coefficients

Forgetting to apply (or applying incorrectly) the borough-specific coefficient.

**Solution:** Confirm facility location at project start. Double-check coefficient application in your final review.

### Mistake #3: Underestimating Fittings

Fittings (elbows, tees, couplings) often aren't called out explicitly. The rule of thumb: **fittings = 15-25% of pipe material cost.**

**Solution:** Use an allowance or count fittings from drawings if detailed enough.

### Mistake #4: Forgetting System Drain/Recharge

Any work on a charged sprinkler system requires drain down and recharge. Easy to miss, expensive to absorb.

**Solution:** Add 21 05 00.20 and 21 05 00.30 to every sprinkler modification project.

### Mistake #5: Ignoring Occupied Facility Requirements

HHC hospitals operate 24/7. Work often requires:

- Off-hours scheduling (nights/weekends)
- Infection control measures
- Coordination with facility operations
- Interim life safety measures

**Solution:** Account for productivity impacts and add appropriate general conditions.

## Tools to Speed Up the Process

Manual HHC fire protection estimating is time-consuming. A typical task order might take 4-8 hours to price accurately—and that's if you know the UPB well.

**JOCstudio** automates the slow parts:

- **PDF takeoff**: Count heads and measure pipe directly on drawings
- **Auto line item mapping**: AI matches your takeoffs to UPB entries
- **Coefficient calculation**: Borough and contract coefficients applied automatically
- **Proposal generation**: Export audit-ready documentation in minutes

What used to take 8 hours now takes 90 minutes.

## Conclusion

NYC HHC represents a massive opportunity for fire protection contractors—over $100 million in annual spending across 11 hospitals and dozens of facilities. But capturing that work requires mastering the HHC JOC system:

- Understand Division 21 structure and common line items
- Apply borough coefficients correctly
- Map takeoffs to UPB entries precisely
- Document everything for audit

The contractors who win consistently aren't just good at fire protection—they're efficient at JOC estimating.
