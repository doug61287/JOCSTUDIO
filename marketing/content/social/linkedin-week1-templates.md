## POST 1: Founder Origin Story

**Best Time:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 8-10am EST  
**Goal:** Build connection, establish credibility

---

8 years ago, I spent 12 hours on a single JOC proposal.

Printed out the drawings. Counted sprinkler heads with a highlighter. Measured pipe runs with a scale ruler. Flipped through a 400-page Unit Price Book.

Built the whole thing in Excel, line by line.

12 hours.

We won the job. $47,000 contract value. But when I calculated my actual estimating cost? 

I'd spent $600+ in labor just to win a $47K project.

That's when I realized: JOC estimating is broken.

Not the concept—JOC is brilliant. Pre-qualified contractors. Standardized pricing. Fast turnaround.

But the *tools*? They haven't evolved since the 90s.

So I started building something better.

That's JOCstudio.

It's the software I wish existed 8 years ago. PDF takeoff, automated line item mapping, coefficient calculations—everything fire protection contractors need to turn 8-hour estimates into 90-minute proposals.

We're in beta now. Launching publicly this quarter.

If you estimate NYC HHC, DCAS, or any JOC contract—I'd love to show you what we're building.

The 12-hour estimate? Never again.

The #1 mistake I see in JOC proposals?

Forgetting the system drain and recharge.

Here's what happens:

You're pricing a sprinkler modification. Count the heads. Measure the pipe. Map everything to the UPB.

Looks good. Submit the proposal.

Then the task order gets audited.

"Where's the drain down? Where's the recharge?"

You absorbed $800 in work you didn't price.

On an $8,000 task order, that's 10% of your margin. Gone.

The fix is simple: Create a checklist.

Every sprinkler modification gets:
□ 21 05 00.20 - System Drain Down
□ 21 05 00.30 - System Recharge
□ 21 05 00.10 - Mob/Demob

No exceptions. Every time.

It's not the complex stuff that kills your margins. It's the basics you forget when you're rushing.

What's your most commonly missed line item?

Building JOCstudio in public: Day 47

This week we broke something important. On purpose.

Our line item mapper was "working." 

It matched takeoff items to UPB entries with 85% accuracy. Pretty good, right?

Wrong.

85% accuracy means 15% of your proposal is *wrong.* On a 100-line task order, that's 15 line items an auditor will flag.

Unacceptable.

So we tore it down and rebuilt it.

New approach: Instead of guessing once, we show you the top 3 matches and let you confirm. Human-in-the-loop.

Accuracy jumped to 99%+.

Lesson: "Pretty good" isn't good enough when your customers' proposals are on the line.

Transparency > Perfection.

What are you rebuilding this week?

## POST 4: Industry Insight

**Best Time:** Tuesday, 2-4pm EST  
**Goal:** Demonstrate market knowledge, attract prospects

NYC HHC awarded $47M in fire protection JOCs last year.

$47 million.

Across 11 hospitals. Dozens of clinics. 5 boroughs.

But here's what most contractors don't realize:

80% of that work went to just 12 companies.

Not because they're the only qualified contractors.

Because they're the fastest estimators.

HHC issues a task order request. The contractor who responds first with an accurate proposal wins. Speed matters more than price (within reason).

The winning contractors aren't using highlighters and Excel.

They have systems. Templates. Tools.

If you're not bidding HHC fire protection, you're leaving money on the table.

And if you ARE bidding but losing to the same competitors... it's not your pricing.

It's your process.

Are you bidding NYC HHC? What's your biggest challenge?

## POST 5: Product/CTA

**Best Time:** Friday, 9-11am EST  
**Goal:** Drive sign-ups, showcase product

Just shipped: Automatic borough coefficient application.

What it does:
Set your project location once → JOCstudio applies the correct multiplier to every line item.

Manhattan (1.25), Bronx (1.15), Brooklyn (1.10), Queens (1.10), Staten Island (1.05).

No more manual math. No more forgetting. No more auditor questions.

Why it matters:
I've seen $50K proposals rejected because someone applied Manhattan coefficients to a Queens job.

Wrong multiplier = wrong price = lost work (or lost money if you win).

Now it's automatic.

One of those features that seems small until you realize how often it goes wrong.

Try it free → jocstudio.com

What feature would save you the most time?
