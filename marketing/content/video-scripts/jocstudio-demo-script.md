## [0:00-0:30] HOOK

**[ON SCREEN: Title card - "From PDF to JOC Proposal in 10 Minutes"]**

**VOICEOVER:**

"Fire protection takeoff for NYC HHC used to take me 8 hours.

Downloading the PDF. Printing it out. Counting heads with a highlighter. Measuring pipe with a scale. Flipping back and forth through a 400-page Unit Price Book. Building a spreadsheet line by line.

8 hours. For one task order.

Now? It takes me 90 minutes. Same accuracy. Same detail. Fraction of the time.

I'm going to show you exactly how—start to finish—right now."

## [0:30-2:00] SETUP

**[ON SCREEN: JOCstudio dashboard]**

**VOICEOVER:**

"Here's JOCstudio. I'm already logged in. Let's create a new project.

**[Click: New Project]**

I'll call this 'Jacobi FP Upgrade' and set the location to Bronx—that's going to auto-apply our 1.15 borough coefficient later.

**[Fill in project details]**

Now let's upload the drawings. I've got the fire protection plans from the task order request—three sheets, about 15 megabytes total.

**[Drag and drop PDF upload]**

JOCstudio is processing the PDF... extracting pages... and we're ready.

**[Pages appear in project]**

Before we start measuring, we need to calibrate the scale. I'll find a dimension on the drawing—here's a door that's marked as 3 feet.

**[Select calibration tool, draw line across 3' door]**

Three feet. Done. Now every measurement we take will be accurate.

Let's get into the actual work."

## [2:00-6:00] THE DEMO - TAKEOFF

**[ON SCREEN: Fire protection floor plan with measurement tools visible]**

**VOICEOVER:**

"First, I'm going to set up my layers. This keeps everything organized and makes it easy to export later.

**[Click: Add Layer → "Sprinkler Heads"]**  
**[Click: Add Layer → "Piping"]**  
**[Click: Add Layer → "Valves & Specialties"]**

Now the fun part—measuring the actual systems.

### Counting Sprinkler Heads

**[Switch to Sprinkler Heads layer]**

I'll start with sprinkler heads. In the toolbar, I select the count tool and choose 'Pendant Head - Standard Response.'

**[Begin clicking on sprinkler head symbols]**

Click... click... click. Each head gets marked. The counter in the sidebar is updating in real-time—see that? We're at 12... 15... 18 heads on this branch.

**[Continue counting]**

I can zoom in if the drawing's dense. Here's a tight corridor... 4 more heads.

**[Zoom and count]**

For sidewall heads—common in closets and small rooms—I switch to 'Sidewall Head' in the dropdown.

**[Switch head type, count a few sidewalls]**

Now I can see the breakdown: 47 pendant heads, 8 sidewall heads, 3 concealed heads in the lobby ceiling.

### Measuring Pipe

**[Switch to Piping layer]**

Pipe is where JOCstudio really shines. I'm going to trace the main lines.

This is 2-inch main running down the corridor. I'll select '2" Black Steel' and just click to trace the run.

**[Click-to-click pipe tracing along corridor]**

JOCstudio is calculating the length automatically—see the measurement appearing as I go. This run is... 86 feet.

**[Complete the trace]**

Let me do the branch lines. These are 1-inch feeding the sprinkler heads.

**[Trace branch lines, faster pace]**

And here's a 4-inch riser connection—different pipe size, I just switch in the dropdown.

**[Trace 4" section]**

After about three minutes, I've got all my piping measured:
- 86 LF of 2" pipe
- 234 LF of 1" pipe  
- 45 LF of 1-1/2" pipe
- 12 LF of 4" pipe

Without JOCstudio, this would've taken me an hour with a scale ruler.

### Marking Valves and Specialties

**[Switch to Valves layer]**

Last layer—valves and specialties. I'll mark the locations:

**[Click on valve symbols]**

OS&Y gate valve here... alarm check valve at the riser... inspector's test connection... fire department connection on the exterior.

**[Mark FDC on exterior]**

I'm also going to add the system drain—that's on this floor—and mark where we need firestops. These pipes penetrate the rated corridor wall here, here, and here.

**[Mark penetration points]**

Done with takeoff. Total time so far: about 6 minutes."

## [6:00-9:00] JOC MAGIC - LINE ITEM MAPPING

**[ON SCREEN: Transition to JOC mapping interface]**

**VOICEOVER:**

"Here's where it gets really good. I've got my quantities. Now I need to map them to HHC's Unit Price Book.

In the old days, this meant flipping through a PDF, finding line items, copying prices into Excel. Tedious and error-prone.

Watch this.

**[Click: Map to UPB]**

JOCstudio knows we're on an HHC contract. It's analyzing our takeoff items and matching them to UPB line items automatically.

**[Show mapping interface populating]**

47 pendant heads → 21 10 10.10, Sprinkler Head, Pendant, Standard Response  
86 LF of 2" pipe → 21 10 20.30, Black Steel Pipe, Schedule 40, 2"  
OS&Y valve → 21 10 30.20  

And so on. Each item gets the correct line number, description, and base price.

**[Scroll through mapped items]**

I can review each match. If something looks wrong—say the drawing specifies quick-response heads but I defaulted to standard—I just click and adjust.

**[Demo changing a line item]**

Now watch the coefficients apply.

**[Click: Apply Coefficients]**

Borough coefficient for Bronx: 1.15. Automatically applied to every line.

My contract coefficient—let's say it's 1.02. Applied.

**[Show coefficient columns in the table]**

The extension is done. Base price times quantity times 1.15 times 1.02 equals my proposal price.

### Generating the Proposal

**[Click: Generate Proposal]**

JOCstudio builds the complete proposal package:

- Cover sheet with project info
- Line item breakdown in HHC format
- Quantity backup with annotated drawing references
- Coefficient calculation summary

**[Show proposal preview]**

I can export this as Excel for additional editing, or as PDF for submission.

**[Click: Export to Excel]**  
**[Click: Export to PDF]**

That's it. We're done."

## [9:00-10:00] RESULTS

**[ON SCREEN: Split screen - completed proposal + timer]**

**VOICEOVER:**

"Let's look at what we just accomplished.

**[Show completed proposal on screen]**

A complete NYC HHC fire protection task order proposal:
- 58 sprinkler heads across 3 types
- 377 linear feet of pipe across 4 sizes
- 6 valves and specialties
- Firestops, drain down, recharge, mob/demob

Every line item mapped. Every coefficient applied. Audit-ready documentation.

**[Show timer: 87 minutes]**

Total time: 87 minutes.

**[GRAPHIC: Split screen comparison]**
- Traditional method: 8 hours
- With JOCstudio: 87 minutes

That's an 82% reduction in estimating time. And this wasn't a simple project—this was a full floor upgrade with multiple systems.

For smaller task orders—head replacements, valve repairs—you're looking at 15-20 minutes.

Think about what you could do with 6 extra hours per proposal. More bids. Better accuracy. Actually going home on time."
